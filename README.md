# analyze_bifurcation_data
 The purpose of this code is to use Python to analyze data from my PhD, where I had participants follow a crowd that split (in an increasing manner) in two directions. The purpose of this experiment was to determine when individuals stop averaging the direction of motion of two groups and follow individual sub-groups.
